# <Challenge-1>

## User Story

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines.

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## Description

For this project I added semantic HTML elements to the exisiting code, changed the 
order of some of the sections in the HTML, added alt attributes to the images, added a title to the webpage, and added comments to the CSS style sheet. These changes made 
the website have improved organization and flow. In doing this, I learned how to structure a basic website.
