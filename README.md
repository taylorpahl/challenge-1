# <Challenge-1>

## Description

For this project I added semantic HTML elements to the exisiting code, changed the 
order of some of the sections in the HTML, added alt attributes to the images, added a title to the webpage, and added comments to the CSS style sheet. These changes made 
the website have improved organization and flow. In doing this, I learned how to structure a basic website.
